The 2020 Summer Olympics officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad and commonly known as Tokyo 2020, is an international multi-sport event scheduled to
take place from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. Originally due to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed in March 2020
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite being rescheduled for 2021, the Games have retained the "Tokyo 2020" name for marketing and branding purposes.
This marks the first time that the Olympics Games have been postponed to a later date rather than cancelled altogether.
