The Olympics Games or Olympiads are the largest multidisciplinary international sporting event in which athletes from different parts 
of the world participate. The Olympics Games are considered the main competition in the sports world, with more than two hundred

of two years, according to the Olympic Charter: «The Games of the Olympiad are held during the first year of an Olympiad, and the Games 
Winter Olympics in their third year.
The modern Olympics Games were inspired by the ancient Olympics Games of the 8th century BC. Organized in ancient Greece with 
headquarters in the city of Olympia, carried out between 776 BC. C. and 393 of our era. In the 19th century, the idea of ​​holding 
events similar to those organized in antiquity arose, which would take place mainly thanks to the efforts of the French nobleman 
Pierre Frédy, Baron de Coubertin. Baron de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. Since then, the 
IOC has become the coordinating body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.
