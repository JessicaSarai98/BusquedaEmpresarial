The 2020 Games will see the introduction of new competitions including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and madison cycling, 
as well as further mixed events. Under new IOC policies, which allow the host organizing committee to add new sports to the 
Olympic programme to augment the permanent core events, these Games will see karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding 
make their Olympic debuts, as well as the return of baseball and softball for the first time since 2008.
