Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.
The 2020 Games will mark the second time that Japan—and specifically Tokyo—has hosted the Summer Olympic Games, the
first being in 1964, making it the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice. Overall, these will be the fourth 
Olympic Games to be held in Japan, which also hosted the Winter Olympics in 1972 (Sapporo) and 1998 (Nagano). The 2020 Games
will also be the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, the first being in Pyeongchang County, South
 Korea in 2018, and the next in Beijing, China in 2022.
