The coronavirus vaccine will not be mandatory for athletes at the Tokyo Olympics, postponed to next year due to the pandemic, 
the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Thomas Bach, said on Tuesday.
Demanding vaccines would be "going too far," judged Bach, visiting Tokyo to try to convince the Japanese population and 
the sponsors of the 2020 Games that the event could be played in July with spectators, despite the recent upsurge in infections.
