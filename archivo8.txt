The IOC voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system. None of the candidate cities won more than 50 percentage of the votes in the first round; 
Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. 
The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 
votes required for a majority.
